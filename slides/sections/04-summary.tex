\section*{Summary}

\begin{frame}{\secname}
What we covered
\begin{itemize}
    \item Representing string figures as linear sequences
    \note{we trace the fingers and the crossings}
    \note{we can easily store it as a list of symbols for computers to use}
    \item Applying twist and pick to linear sequences
    \note{they reflect the movements we do physically on string figures}
    \note{they create new crossings}
\end{itemize}

Going deeper

\begin{itemize}
    \item More moves 
    \item Drawing diagrams from linear sequences
\end{itemize}
