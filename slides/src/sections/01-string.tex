\section{String Figures}

\begin{frame}{\secname}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designs formed from a loop of string
    \item Commonly known as a children's game
\end{itemize}

\pause People have been playing with the string around the world for millennia.

\begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
    \item  Entertainment during polar nights in the Arctic region
    \item  Storytelling and illustrating scenes from myths and legends
\end{itemize}

\pause \textcolor{red}{todo insert 3 images of strings figures from the encyclopedia: the star, something i can do, something i cant do}

\note[item]{the native inhabitants in the arctic region play string figures for entertainment }
\note[item]{the indigenous people in New Zealand play string figures for storytelling and illustrating scenes from myths and legends}
\note[item]{and i play string figures when overleaf takes forever to compile my slides}

\begin{frame}{A Computational Approach}
String figures take a lot of steps to make

\begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
    \item  Start with an initial position
    \item  Apply a sequence of moves
    \item  Each move transforms a string figure to another
\end{itemize}

\pause String figures computations

\begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
    \item  Represent string figures: simple, precise
    \item  Apply moves directly to the representations
\end{itemize}

\pause Motivation

\begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
    \item Do string figures on paper
    \item Computer simulations \& animations
\end{itemize}

\note[item]{ (take steps) for example, to make the star, we start with this initial position, an}d then apply two simple moves of picking a segment of the string 
\note[item]{ (mot) clear way of describing how to make string figures}
\note[item]{ (mot) teach computers how to play string figures}
\note[item]{ (record) store in computer, as database}
\note[item]{ simliar to music scores, rubiks cubes}
\note[item]{ one effective way of describing string figures is to draw them, as string diagrams}
